	<!-- The file name of the svg image which should be used for this place type's icon.
	If you leave this blank, or omit it entirely, then the game will look for an svg file of the same name as this file within the same folder (i.e. 'entry_east.svg').
		Failing to find an svg image of that name, then this place type will not have an image associated with it.
	This can be useful for if there are several types of place type which all want to use the same svg, but you don't want to copy+paste the same svg and rename it for each place type.
	This place does not have an svg associated with it, but if you wanted to add one, then define it like so (*without* the '.svg' on the end):
		<svgName>your_file_name</svgName> -->
	<svgName>door</svgName>
	
	<!-- The colour which the associated svg icon will be recoloured to.
	You can define this as either a PresetColour value or a raw colour hex.
	If defining a raw colour hex, use this format: <colour>#cafe69</colour>
	Values can be found here: https://github.com/Innoxia/liliths-throne-public/blob/dev/src/com/lilithsthrone/utils/colours/PresetColour.java -->
	<colour>BASE_WHITE</colour>
	
	<!-- The background colour of this placeType's tile.
	You can define this as either a PresetColour value or a raw colour hex, although this should most often simply be left as 'MAP_BACKGROUND', which is the game's default value.
	Changing this colour for too many place types can end up with the map looking like a very odd mix of colours, and so in most cases it's best to leave any recolouring to the svg icon above.
	If defining a raw colour hex, use this format: <colour>#cafe69</colour>
	Values can be found here: https://github.com/Innoxia/liliths-throne-public/blob/dev/src/com/lilithsthrone/utils/colours/PresetColour.java -->
	<backgroundColour>BASE_GREEN_LIGHT</backgroundColour>
	
	<!-- The id of the Encounter which can be triggered on this place type.
	You can omit this entirely or use the value 'null' if there is no associated Encounter.
	Please note that if a place type has multiple different 'encounterTypes' associated with it (via being set in the encounter file itself), one of those lists will be chosen at random to have an encounter drawn from it. -->
