	<!-- HALLWAY -->
	
	<htmlContent tag="HALLWAY"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		White walls and beige carpets. Despite the fact that Felicia has lived here for long enough to have gotten to know Arthur quite well, her apartment looks like she's only just moved in to it. Your immediate surroundings are void of decoration or furniture of any kind. The only things that stick out are the lights and the open-plan views of the apartment's dining and living rooms.

	<!-- ENTRYWAY -->
	
	<htmlContent tag="ENTRYWAY"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		The entryway of [felicia.namePos] apartment is as empty as the rest of it, with the only item of note being the brown doormat beneath your [pc.feet]. With plain, white walls and a complete lack of decoration, there's almost nothing in this area that would be capable of holding your attention for more than a brief moment. The only things of interest are the heavy wooden door that leads out into the apartment building's corridor, and, to your right, an internal door which has been left open, granting you an unobstructed view into what very well might be the least interesting coat closet ever created. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Your only real options in this area are to turn around and head back into Felicia's apartment, or to call out goodbye and use the door to make your exit...

	<htmlContent tag="FELICIA_BEDROOM"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		The door to Felicia's bedroom is closed, and with the dog-girl watching you out of the corner of her eye, you realise that it would be a terrible idea to try and take a look inside. Turning away from the door, you wonder what to do next...

	<!-- BATHROOM -->
	
	<htmlContent tag="BATHROOM"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		The door to the apartment's bathroom is closed, and as you take a look at it, Felicia calls out, [felicia.speech(If you need to use the toilet, go ahead.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		From the sharp tone in her voice, you realise that she's just saying that to be polite, and would prefer you to not make use of her bathroom. Not wanting to annoy her, you tell her that you don't need the loo right now and turn away from the bathroom door...
	</p>

	<!-- KITCHEN -->
	
	<htmlContent tag="KITCHEN"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		As is the case throughout most of Felicia's open-plan apartment, there's no wall separating this area from her dining area or living room, giving the kitchen a pleasant, open feel to it. Beneath your [pc.feet], the usual beige carpet has been replaced with light brown, laminated wooden flooring.
	</p>
	<p>
		The left wall is lined with marble-topped counters, and in the middle of them, a sink is positioned in front of a window that overlooks the streets of Demon Home below. At the border between the kitchen and living room there's a white, arcane-powered fridge, and sitting atop it, you see what must be the only colourful item in the entire apartment; a bright pink stuffed teddy bear. Beside it is the stove and a small, additional section of workspace, but apart from that, the kitchen is as barren as the rest of the apartment.
	</p>
	]]>
	</htmlContent>
	
	
	<!-- DINING_AREA -->
	
	<htmlContent tag="DINING_AREA"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		In the middle of the room is a single, light brown table that looks to be just barely large enough to seat two people. You're unable to test this hypothesis out, however, as there's only one chair present, which is of the same drab brown shade as the table.
	</p>
	<p>
		Looking around, you see that this dining room is just as devoid of decoration as the rest of the apartment, and there's nothing on the table, not even a salt shaker. Instead of the beige carpet found throughout the main section of the apartment, the dining room shares the same light brown wooden floor as the kitchen; its shade almost perfectly matches that of the 'dining set'.
	</p>
	<p>
		As is the case throughout most of Felicia's apartment, there's no separating wall around this dining room, granting you an unobstructed view of the kitchen and hallway.
	</p>

	<!-- LIVING_AREA -->
	
	<htmlContent tag="LIVING_AREA"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		The living room is home to most of the apartment's furniture, which consists of a dark green sofa, a light brown coffee table, and a bookcase filled to the brim with an assortment of books. Next to the bookcase is a window, which opens to a view of the streets of Demon Home. There's no wall on two sides of this room, allowing you to look into the kitchen and hallway, while on the third side there's a firmly-closed door which leads into Felicia's bedroom.
	</p>
	<p>
		Felicia is sitting on the sofa, and although she occasionally glances up to see if you're still around, the vast majority of her attention is focused on the book that's in her paw-like hands.

I'm around in the mornings until about three in the afternoon, so if you ever need me, come back between those times,)] she states, before leaning over towards the bookshelf and picking out a book seemingly at random. Before she opens it, she flashes you a small smile, then begins to read.

		[pc.Stepping] away from the sofa, you wonder whether to head straight to the apartment's exit, or instead take some time to have a quick look around the place...

		Reassuring Felicia by telling her that Arthur is doing well, you explain that he's going to be staying in Lilaya's mansion for the foreseeable future. Seeing the worried look in her eyes, you quickly tell the dog-girl that Rose will be sure to let her in to visit Arthur at any time, and you happily give her Lilaya's address.
