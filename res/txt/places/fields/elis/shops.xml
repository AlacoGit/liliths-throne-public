			Standard Opening Times: [units.time(9)]-[units.time(17)]

			<b>History</b>
			<br/>
			How did this shopping precinct come into being? Why is it called 'Wall's End'? And why is it needed when the farmer's market already exists? Woah, so many questions! Thankfully, all three can be answered by recounting a little of our wonderful town's history!
			<br/><br/>
			As you might already know, in the past our town was just a village, although a village that was destined to grow into the best town in all of Lilith's Realm. Of course, as with any growing population, Elis soon had need of commercial premises which couldn't be accommodated by simple market stalls. As such, our wonderful mayor, Minotallys, decreed that a shopping precinct needed to be created.
			<br/><br/>
			This decision coincided with the most ambitious construction project Elis has ever seen. Known to the locals as 'the northern expansion', a portion of the defensive walls needed to be torn down and rebuilt so as to accommodate an entirely new district. Where you're standing right now is where that northern wall once stood, hence it was agreed that this shopping precinct should honour that history by being called 'Wall's End'!
			<br/><br/>
			I hope that answers your questions, and now you can get to shopping! Make sure to spend lots of money to help keep our economy ticking!
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p>
			<b>Businesses</b>
			<br/>
			Here at Wall's End we've got a convenience store, a place for clothes shopping, and even a massage parlour! Who needs to go to Dominion when you've got everything you could ever need right here?!
			<br/><br/>
			Most businesses are open six days a week, between [units.time(9)]-[units.time(17)]. The convenience store is open 24/7, however, so even if it's the middle of the night there's no reason for you not to come in and take a look around!

			'[style.colourMinorGood([units.time(9)]-[units.time(17), weekdays only])]', meaning that it's currently [style.colourGood(open)]. If you wanted to make use of any of the three services which this business provides, there's nothing stopping you from heading inside...

	<p>
		Running around the shopping precinct in a circular fashion, this cobblestone street is very similar to the ones found throughout the rest of Elis. While the arcane street lamps are slightly different to the others in the town, they're still of an old, ornate design which adds to the surrounding timber-framed buildings' appearance to give this area a late-medieval aesthetic.
	</p>

		#IF(game.getHourOfDay()>=9 && game.getHourOfDay()<17)
			Thanks to the hour of day,

				 some

			 of the shops here are currently open, and there are a great deal of people either walking around with shopping bags in their hands or
			#IF(game.getCurrentWeather()==WEATHER_RAIN)
				 standing beneath the shops' canvas awnings so as to be protected from the rain.
			#ELSE
				 sitting on one of the many wooden benches which line the sides of the street.
			#ENDIF
		#ELSE
			Due to the current hour, almost all of the shops here are currently closed, although there are still some people to be seen either out taking a walk around the precinct or heading to or from the convenience store.

	<htmlContent tag="TOILETS"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Wherever there's a concentration of members of the public, there exists the need for offering restroom facilities. Wall's End is no exception to this, and has met this need by converting the ground floor of one of the timber-framed buildings into public toilets.
	</p>
	<p>
		A sign next to the entrance informs you that these facilities are open 24/7 and are cleaned at least once per hour, in addition to asking members of the public to please treat the toilets with respect. An additional sign has been attached beneath this one at what you assume to be a later date, and reminds the reader that the creation of glory holes in the stalls is considered to be vandalism, and is punishable by a fine of up to one hundred flames.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you wanted to, you could head inside the public toilets and make use of them, or instead turn around and head back into Wall's End...

	<htmlContent tag="TOILETS_INTERIOR"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Deciding that you want to make use of the public toilets, you head inside and take a look around. While the stalls and sinks are of the usual public restroom quality, everything looks to be very well maintained, with the entire interior being nothing short of spotlessly clean. The steady hum of arcane-powered ventilation shafts produces a slightly-unpleasant monotonous background noise, but it's a minor discomfort worth paying to ensure that the air is kept fresh and odour-free.
	</p>
	<p>
		#IF(game.getHourOfDay()>=9 && game.getHourOfDay()<17)
			A few of the stalls are currently occupied, while a couple of members of the public are making use of the sinks before heading back out into Wall's End to continue their shopping. As you walk past these people,
		#ELSE
			Due to the current time, these toilets are completely deserted. As you walk down the entire length of the restroom,
		#ENDIF
		#IF(!game.getDialogueFlags().hasFlag(FLAG_innoxia_elis_toilets_hole_ever_made))
			 you notice that there's not a single glory hole between any of the stalls, and you wonder if the exterior sign's threat of a fine has put people off making one, or if the local population just aren't into that sort of thing...
		#ELSEIF(game.getDialogueFlags().hasFlag(FLAG_innoxia_elis_toilets_hole_made))
			 you see that the glory hole which you previously made hasn't yet been repaired, and you wonder if it's worth the risk of being discovered and fined to make use of it...
		#ELSE
			 you notice that the glory hole which you previously made has been flawlessly repaired, and you wonder if it's worth the risk of being discovered and fined to make another one...
		#ENDIF

		[pc.Stepping] into one of the empty stalls, you turn and lock the door behind you, before making use of the toilet. After you've finished, you flush the toilet before making your way over to one of the sinks and washing your [pc.hands]. Grabbing a paper towel from the nearby dispenser, you quickly dry yourself off, before turning to face the room and wondering what to do next...

	<htmlContent tag="TOILETS_MAKE_HOLE"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Looking around to make sure that there's no member of the cleaning staff or an Enforcer in the restroom, you enter one of the stalls and take out your bladed weapon. Slicing it into the thin wooden wall of the stall, you swiftly slice it around in a small circle, before popping out the round piece of wood and admiring the glory hole you've just made.
	</p>
	<p>
		Feeling turned on at the thought of being the one responsible for the lewd acts which will undoubtedly be performed in this stall's immediate future, you put away your blade and take a look through to the stall that's connected to this one. Nobody's in there right now, but it's only a matter of time before your act of vandalism is discovered, and you wonder whether it's time for you to leave or to risk the chance of being fined in order to dominantly use the glory hole or submissively service it...
